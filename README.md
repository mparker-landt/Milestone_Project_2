# Whack-A-Mole

Whack-A-Mole is an interactive frontend website created to meet the criteria of the Code Institute Milestone Project 2. \
The website hosts a game of Whack-a-Mole that in a random time has a random number of moles pop up for which the user has to click. Everytime a mole is hit the user score increases. If a mole is not present and the user clicks the hammer HP decreases, if it hits zero the game ends.

## UX
### User Demographic
The game was designed for any user from age 5 onwards. Although probably more appealing to younger players it can be played by any age and offers a simple fun time to all.
### User Stories
#### First time User Stories:
* As a first time visitor I want to quickly understand the purpose of the website.
* As a first time visitor I want to learn how to play the game and easily start a new game. 
* As a first time visitor I want to be able to find the author and details for the creator of the site.
#### Returning User Stories:
* As a returning user I want to start playing the game quickly and efficiently.
* As a returning user I want to be able to play the game to beat my previous high score.
* As a returning user I want to be able to see if there have been any updates or changes to the game.

### Design
The website was designed to be a single-page site developed first for mobile size screens. As the game is quite intuitive and easy to learn the UI design was kept minimal and any visual aspects kept to a minimum.
#### Wireframes
